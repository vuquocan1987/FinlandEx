    "# Here is a brief Description of our project: \n",
    "\n",
    "## This project is based on the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Our team members collaborated and communicated through zoom,whatsapp, trello, and github to make this project into what it is today. This is a two player game that runs off of user input.  For our first step we defined the conditions needed to be able to win the game in a list using brackets. Our second step was to import displays and widgets to give us the interactive squares for the game. After this, we  defined the functions of this project and used classes and subclasses to make this game interactive to the user. Then, we  used for, if, and elif loops and conditions to continue this game until there was a clear and defined winner. Finally, we called the game in a seperate cell for the user and a friend to be able to play. "
